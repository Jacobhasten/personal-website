        I was always known for my quick wit, charm and artistry since a young age. When I was 19, I went into video editing 
        for 2 years for a local film production company in the 5 Towns on Long Island. We created emotionally captivating videos for 
        fundraising dinners and various promotional materials.  And so began my journey into tech....</p></div>
            <div className="bio-text-container-paragraph"><p className="bio-paragraph">After leaving, I earned an associates degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at Touro College with a high 
        GPA and was granted a scholarship to Hofstra University. At Hofstra, public relations became my major. 
        Unfortunately the more I learned about the industry, the less I wanted to pursue it. </p> </div>
            <div className="bio-text-container-paragraph"><p className="bio-paragraph"> In my mid-to-late 20s, 
        I moved into full-time sales positions in New York.  But as I started to mature, my desire for creating and being intellectually 
        challenged grew and closing deals started to feel less purposeful. While I enjoyed spending time with clients and showcasing 
        rental apartments in Brooklyn, I also noticed that the real estate industry was overly crowded with agents and that consumers
        were increasingly getting their value from web applications like Zillow, StreetEasy and other technological shopping tools.  
        Frankly, I felt my position as an agent was becoming obsolete. I had also found some purpose in New York Life Insurance sales, 
        protecting vulnerable families so if something happened to their bread-winners, there was a bit of financial peace of mind for their 
        loved ones. But my role here wasn't very challenging creatively.</p>  </div>
            <div className="bio-text-container-paragraph"><p className="bio-paragraph">Making the leap to learning UX Design was more of a logical one than a pursuit of passion. I was also very inspired by opportunities in tech and fortunately, 
        I fell in love with my daily tasks and hands-on assignments at Kenzie Academy. I wanted to be a part of the solution, the future, rather than feel like I was stuck in 
        fields where technology was making experienced employees expendable. Kenzie gave me perfect guidance to become a UI engineer: 6 months of learning and implementing 
        up-to-date UX design practices and 6 months of front-end development. During this challenging pandemic year, I supported myself driving Uber, Lyft and DoorDash 
        many evenings. Nothing, however, got me more excited than solving those seemingly impossible JavaScript problems and collaborating on team projects with other
        ambitious, passionate and like-minded individuals.

            <div className="bio-text-container-paragraph"> <p className="bio-paragraph">Today, I am seeking my first role as a Junior UI developer. Although these skills are fresh, the creativity behind them isn’t. During my sales years, 
        I spent many spare hours devoted to artistic pursuits like DJing and collaborative event planning for small music festivals.  Working on group assignments at 
        Kenzie reminded me what it felt like to build something beautiful again with a team of individuals from diverse backgrounds. Although the projects were small, 
        I had room to share my ideas, and there was no better feeling than getting to make those ideas a reality.  Looking forward to the near future, I'm truly excited
        to see what I get to build and the positive impact it’ll make on our world.
